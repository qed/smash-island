// Boots artifacts/V1/index.html (the UNTOUCHED reference monolith) inside jsdom so the golden
// recorder can drive the REAL game loop + REAL updateHUD headlessly. This file is the harness's
// jsdom adapter; it never edits the monolith and never stubs HUD/game-state logic — the only shim
// is a minimal 2D-canvas context so draw() doesn't throw in jsdom (explicitly sanctioned).
//
// NOTE (why this deviates from the brief's illustrative snippet): the monolith is one classic
// <script>. Its top-level state (`const SETTINGS`, `let fighters`, `const down`, `let TOURNEY`, …)
// lives in the global LEXICAL environment, which — unlike `function` declarations — is NOT exposed
// as window properties. Empirically `dom.window.SETTINGS === undefined`. So we (a) install the
// canvas shim in `beforeParse` (the eval-time `const ctx = cv.getContext('2d')` runs DURING parse,
// so a post-construction assignment is too late), (b) seed the monolith's OWN realm Math.random
// (jsdom runs scripts in a separate realm; Node-global Math.random never reaches it), (c) neutralize
// requestAnimationFrame so the monolith's self-driven loop doesn't fire in the background — the
// recorder drives step() synchronously and deterministically, and (d) bridge the lexical globals
// onto the window as LIVE accessors (reads/writes go through eval in the same realm, so they hit
// the real bindings and re-read after any internal reassignment of `fighters`). None of this
// touches HUD or game logic — updateHUD/draw/updateStandings run as the monolith wrote them.

// Minimal 2D-canvas-context shim: no-op for drawing calls; the few methods draw() dereferences a
// RETURN value from (gradients, measureText, getImageData) hand back a benign object so the REAL
// draw() runs to completion instead of throwing. HUD DOM text is still produced by the real code.
